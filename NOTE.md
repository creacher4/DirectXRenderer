hi.

im creacher4, the creator of this engine. i just wanna say, this might be the worst code i've ever written in my life, but it's probably also the most code i've ever written too. i think i've written more code in this one project than i ever have before combined.

after crashing out multiple times while trying to refactor this mess of a program, i decided to take the ECS approach. and now im having nightmares about the phrase 'separation of concerns'.

what i've come to realise is that after struggling to properly comment my work, i'd much rather create documentation for it, either using doxygen or gitbooks and then just linking the documentation wherever i need to in the codebase.

yes, i know the difference between this and the previous version is gigantic but as someone who's entire mood relies on if their program works or not, i got a bit too excited when it did start working. i also never stop. if it works, i'll just move on to adding some other feature instead of trying to fix my codebase and improve it's efficiency. i also haven't added any debugging.

there originally was a debug class buried somewhere inside the program but then my professor told me about breakpoints so yeah. you can guess what happened to the debug class.

but yeah, let me stop yapping, i just wanted to say there's a reason there's barely any comments and i know there's lots of inefficient code at the moment, but documentation and fixes are on their way.

im also averaging like 7 hours a day, 6 days a week because i have nothing better to do.

the engine is NOT feature complete yet.
